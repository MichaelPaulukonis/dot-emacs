=========

my emacs configuration files, and extensions

These are here primarily for personal version-control purposes. I used to keep them under CVS but never migrated the repository when I upgraded my home machine. tsk tsk tsk.

Also, I got a lot of help from online .emacs files when I was starting out using Emacs (which may still be my current state, lo, these many years later). So if anything in here has the chance of being useful to someone else in return, it should be made public.

Here we go.....
