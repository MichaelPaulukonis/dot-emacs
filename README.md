My emacs configuration files, and extensions

These are here primarily for personal version-control purposes. I used to keep them under CVS but never migrated the repository when I upgraded my home machine. tsk tsk tsk.

Having them here should encourage me to update them more proactively.

Also, I got a lot of help from online .emacs files when I was starting out using Emacs (which may still be my current state, lo, these many years later). So if anything in here has the chance of being useful to someone else in return, it should be made public.

Here we go.....

Since this is a legacy file, it may not accurately reflect my views on Emacs. Check out my [EmacsWiki profile](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/MichaelPaulukonis) for more/better information.
